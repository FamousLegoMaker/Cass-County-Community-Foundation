            No. These scholarships are intended to provide only partial support. In addition to applying for scholarships through CCCF, you should look into other financial aid resources such as federal grants, loans and work-study programs. A complete financial package can be put together by your college's financial aid office and may include a portion of each of the above types of financial aid. In addition, you may find other scholarship opportunities by checking with your guidance counselor, other local organizations, or on the Internet.
